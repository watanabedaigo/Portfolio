## Ingenuity
I aimed at the portfolio which remained in the impression from the contrast of the contents of the monotone that was the colorful top photograph which got a lot of looks and a calm atmosphere while doing it assuming a simple, plain thing. The photograph of the top composed the photograph of the destination which went so far, and adopted own hobby.

## Difficulties
- Constitution of the design
- Modal making
- Implementation of respopnsive design

## Impressions
I realized convenience of Bootstrap again. Particularly, I think that the usefulness of the grid system when I implement responsive design is splendid. When I encoded it, at first I implemented about design by Bootstrap and was able to push forward work by a flow to write a small part in css very efficiently.
I finished the making of the portfolio, and the change of job activity to an engineer finally began. **I realized that this was a start again at the same time as the expectation to the coming new life swelled out, and determination to say to make an effort single-mindedly hardened.**
